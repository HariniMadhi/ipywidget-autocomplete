# ipywidget-autocomplete
Autocomplete / Autofill Text field with Dropdown menu to choose between suggested values from a given list.

It's a simple but functional implementation of an autocomplete text field using only ipywidgets elements, so you can use this normally with other widgets.

I've just used a Text ipyWidget, a Dropdown ipyWidget and some CSS magic!
